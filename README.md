### Predicting Gender and Age Range Using OpenCV in Python

Predicting age and gender is a critical aspect of computer vision, especially in surveillance. These predictions have become more accurate and accessible to the general public. This area of study continues to evolve due to its importance in intelligent real-world applications.

## Applications

A person's identity, age, gender, emotions, and ethnicity can be inferred from facial features. Age and gender classification have practical uses in various fields, including:

- Security and video surveillance
- Electronic customer relationship management
- Biometrics
- Electronic vending machines
- Cosmetology
- Forensic art

## Implementation

Age detection typically involves a two-stage process:

1. Face Detection: Identify faces in the input image.
2. Age Detection: Extract the face Region of Interest (ROI) and apply the age detection algorithm to predict the person's age.
